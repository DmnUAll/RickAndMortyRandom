# RickAndMortyRandom
This app is based on https://rickandmortyapi.com API.\
It will show you random character (with info) from Rick and Morty series.\
Initially, the application was supposed to show information about a random animal.\
But the API is no longer supported. Therefore, the application was redesigned for a different API.

This project was the twelfth app writen by myself.\
The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- JSON parsing
- DispatchQueue
- UINavigationController
- UIAlertController

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design.\
All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
